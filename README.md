# My First Project On Github: **Random Message Generator**

### What about this projet? (*it will be very short haha*)

This **"project"** is just a generator of random messages. You can only run the project and a random sentence will appear youhou. But this project is more than that for me. It's been part of my training to be the very best **full-stack developer** in this world. 


### What about me ? (*this project doesn't deserve a lot of text to understand it*)

* It's only a simple javascript file for now but I'll soon be able to make bigger and more complex projects ;)

* For now, I'll just speak about myself. I need to practice this markdown stuff and I need to practice my English too :').

* I'm a 25 years french dude from ... France, I'm actually working but it's not important since it's not related to programming or coding. I studied 5 years to become a good project manager in the video game industry but ... After 5 years and 35K â‚¬ I realized that I don't want to be just a project manager. I want to create with my little hands. Then I started to learn programming and coding by myself since less than a year (it's christmas 2020 right now). And I'm so excited since I started this. So I'll continue and I just want to learn as fast as possible to find a job that will make me and my future family happier. 

### Wtf is that readme ?

Now a ~table~ image, just because I want to learn how to use it in a Readme file lmao.
